<h2>Welcome to our website</h2>
<hr>
<p>Having grown-up in a rather frugal household that seemingly had everything it needed it was always difficult for myself to buy gifts for my close family and even now it's a struggle for my wife and kids to find something to buy for me on my birthday and for Christmas.
</p>
<p>Improving the quality of life of your friends and family is just priceless and that is why I started this website. I just really like helping others and having others recommend useful things to me too!
</p><p>
Over the last decade or so I have received a lot of excellent quality of life products and tools which help me out on the odd occasion and it always brings a smile to my face when I use something that was bought to make my life easier!
